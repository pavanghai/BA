User: What is .jceks file?

ChatGPT: A `.jceks` file is a **Java Cryptography Extension KeyStore** (JCEKS) used for securely storing cryptographic keys, passwords, and other sensitive information. It is commonly used in Hadoop environments to store credentials securely.

User: How to view its content?

ChatGPT: To view the content of a `.jceks` file, you would typically need to use a **Java KeyStore (JKS)** tool like `keytool` or Hadoop's `hadoop credential` commands. However, viewing the passwords or secrets stored in `.jceks` directly is not possible unless you have the necessary permissions and know the alias and keystore password.

User: Can we do it via python?

ChatGPT: You can use Python to interact with `.jceks` files, but there is no direct Python library that supports reading `.jceks` files specifically. However, you can use the `subprocess` module to call Hadoop commands or `keytool` commands to interact with `.jceks` files from Python.

User: Any other library?

ChatGPT: Unfortunately, there are no direct Python libraries to read `.jceks` files, but you can use Hadoop's `hadoop credential` API or Java's `keytool` command-line tool, as mentioned earlier. Python can be used to invoke these commands via `subprocess`.

User: Share Java commands too

ChatGPT: To interact with `.jceks` files in Java, you can use the following commands:

1. **To list entries in a `.jceks` keystore:**
```bash
keytool -list -keystore yourfile.jceks -storetype JCEKS -storepass [alias name]
```

2. **To extract a specific entry (password):**
```bash
keytool -exportcert -keystore yourfile.jceks -storetype JCEKS -alias [alias] -file outputfile
```

User: What if file is in Hadoop layer?

ChatGPT: If the `.jceks` file is stored in **HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System), you can access it using Hadoop's `hadoop credential` command. You will need to specify the full HDFS URI for the `.jceks` file, as Hadoop will be able to securely fetch and use the credentials stored in the file.

For example:
```bash
hadoop credential get [alias] -provider jceks://hdfs/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

User: How do I get secret key?

ChatGPT: To get the **secret key** from a `.jceks` file, you typically need to know the **alias** and the **path** to the `.jceks` file. Use the `hadoop credential` command with the correct alias and file path.

Example:
```bash
hadoop credential get your_alias -provider jceks://hdfs/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

This will return the actual password stored under that alias.

User: Via keytool

ChatGPT: To extract a secret key from a `.jceks` file using `keytool`, you can run the following command:

```bash
keytool -list -keystore yourfile.jceks -storetype JCEKS -storepass [keystore_password]
```

This will list the aliases in the `.jceks` file. However, `keytool` will not directly reveal the **actual secret value** unless you have the proper permissions to decrypt it.

User: Tell me more about Hadoop credentials

ChatGPT: Hadoop credentials are used to securely store sensitive information like passwords and keys, typically in a `.jceks` file. Hadoop provides the **CredentialProvider** API to securely retrieve credentials for things like database access, S3 credentials, etc. You can use the `hadoop credential` command-line tool to interact with the `.jceks` file, list aliases, and fetch the actual credentials.

User: I have password stored in .jceks file located in hdfs path
Sqoop command requires -password-alias to work I want to retrieve masked password

ChatGPT: If you need to retrieve a **masked password** from the `.jceks` file in HDFS to use in a **Sqoop** command, you can use the `hadoop credential` command. Unfortunately, it will return the actual password, not a masked one.

Use the following command to retrieve the actual password:
```bash
hadoop credential get [alias] -provider jceks://hdfs/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

User: I used
keytool -list -keystore yourfile.jceks -storetype JCEKS -storepass [alias name]
I got the entry but no actual password 
Need command to get original password
U can also share Hadoop credentials command

ChatGPT: If you're using `keytool`, you can list the entries but cannot directly reveal the password. Instead, use **Hadoopâs credential commands** to retrieve the actual password stored in the `.jceks` file.

To fetch the password in Hadoop, use:
```bash
hadoop credential get [alias] -provider jceks://hdfs/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

This will return the actual password behind the alias.

User: What if the file is in Hadoop layer?

ChatGPT: If the `.jceks` file is stored in **HDFS**, you should use the `hadoop credential` command with the full HDFS URI to retrieve the password.

Example:
```bash
hadoop credential get [alias] -provider jceks://hdfs/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

User: How do I get secret key?

ChatGPT: To retrieve a **secret key** stored in a `.jceks` file, you use the `hadoop credential` command as follows:

```bash
hadoop credential get [alias] -provider jceks://hdfs/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

This will return the secret key (password) stored under the alias.

User: Via keytool

ChatGPT: `keytool` can be used to manage keys in a `.jceks` file, but it will not directly reveal the stored password. Instead, you should use Hadoopâs `hadoop credential` command to retrieve the secret. Here's how you can use `keytool` to list the keys:

```bash
keytool -list -keystore yourfile.jceks -storetype JCEKS -storepass [password]
```

However, to get the actual password, you need to use Hadoopâs `credential get` command.

User: Tell me more about Hadoop credentials

ChatGPT: Hadoop credentials are stored in a **JCEKS** file, which is a secure way to store sensitive information like passwords and keys. Hadoop provides a command-line tool (`hadoop credential`) to manage and retrieve these secrets. You can use this tool to:
- List aliases in a `.jceks` file.
- Retrieve passwords or keys stored under specific aliases.

This is part of the **Hadoop CredentialProvider API**, which ensures credentials are kept secure in Hadoop-based applications.

User: I want to see the password

ChatGPT: To view the actual password stored in a `.jceks` file, you can use the following command:

```bash
hadoop credential get [alias] -provider jceks://hdfs/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

This command will return the **actual password** associated with the alias `doc_sql_connect`.

User: Is jceks:// required if the file is in local folder?

ChatGPT: Yes, the `jceks://` prefix is required even if the file is stored in a **local folder** because the Hadoop Credential API expects a fully qualified **URI**.

For local files, use:
```bash
hadoop credential get [alias] -provider jceks://file/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

User: Alias is doc_sql_connect

ChatGPT: If your alias is `doc_sql_connect`, and the file is in **HDFS**, you can use the following command to retrieve the actual password:

```bash
hadoop credential get doc_sql_connect -provider jceks://hdfs/path/to/yourfile.jceks
```

This will return the **password** stored under the alias `doc_sql_connect`.

User: What if I want to list all the alias with original password stored?

ChatGPT: To list all aliases along with their corresponding original passwords, you can use the following **bash script** to fetch and display all passwords:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
JCEKS_PATH="jceks://hdfs/user/hadoop/creds/mycreds.jceks"
for alias in $(hadoop credential list -provider "$JCEKS_PATH"); do
  secret=$(hadoop credential get "$alias" -provider "$JCEKS_PATH" 2>/dev/null | awk -F ':' '{print $2}' | xargs)
  echo "$alias : $secret"
done
```

This script lists all aliases and prints their respective passwords.

User: Yes

ChatGPT: Perfect â hereâs a script that will **list all aliases** and retrieve their **actual (unmasked) passwords** from a `.jceks` file stored in **HDFS**.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

JCEKS_PATH="jceks://hdfs/user/hadoop/creds/mycreds.jceks"
for alias in $(hadoop credential list -provider "$JCEKS_PATH"); do
  secret=$(hadoop credential get "$alias" -provider "$JCEKS_PATH" 2>/dev/null | awk -F ':' '{print $2}' | xargs)
  echo "$alias : $secret"
done
```

Run this script to display all the aliases and their actual secrets.
